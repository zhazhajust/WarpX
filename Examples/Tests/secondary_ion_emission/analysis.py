"""
This script checks that electron secondary emission (implemented by a callback function) works as intended.

In this test, four ions hit a spherical embedded boundary, and produce secondary
electrons with a probability of `0.4`. We thus expect ~2 electrons to be produced.
This script tests the number of electrons emitted and checks that their position is
close to the embedded boundary.

# Analytical results
# ------------------
# Parameters read from warpx_used_inputs:
# the sphere (embedded boundary) is centered at the origin and has radius R;
# four ions start at (xi, 0, zi) with proper velocity (gamma*v) (uxi, 0, uzi).
# Since uy0 = 0 and yi = 0, each ion travels in the (x, z) plane.
# When an ion reaches the sphere, it can emit a secondary electron at the
# impact point. The emitted electron then receives a small thermal kick
# (random direction, magnitude ~ sqrt(k Te / m_e)) and is propagated for
# the remaining fraction of the time step. Therefore the deterministic
# (analytical) part of the emitted electron position is the impact point
# of the ion on the sphere; the residual displacement comes from the
# thermal kick and from the embedded-boundary discretization.
# Note: WarpX stores proper velocities normalized by c in warpx_used_inputs.
