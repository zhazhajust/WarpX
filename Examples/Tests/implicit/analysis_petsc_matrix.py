# This is a script that analyses the simulation results from

# This simulates a time-varing EM wave injected from an insulator boundary
# using the theta-implicit solver with PETSc's LU preconditer.
# Since LU is an exact solver, if the preconditioner matrix is constructed
# correctly, then here should be 1 Newton and 1 GMRES iteration per time step.
